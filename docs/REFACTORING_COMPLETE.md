# ✅ Comprehensive Gaze Tester - Refactoring Complete

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **Problem: Multiple Conflicting TTS/Beep Systems**

- ❌ Old: Dual-flag system (`tts_complete`, `recording_complete`) existed but wasn't used
- ❌ Old: Callback-based system existed but didn't check recording
- ✅ New: Single unified callback system that checks BOTH TTS and recording

### **Problem: Recording Started After Beep**

- ❌ Old: Gaze steps started recording AFTER beep (line 1052)
- ❌ Old: Calibration started recording 3 seconds AFTER beep (line 1085)
- ✅ New: Recording starts FIRST, before TTS, for ALL steps

### **Problem: Beep Fired Too Early**

- ❌ Old: Beep fired without checking if recording was ready
- ✅ New: Beep only fires when BOTH TTS complete AND recording ready

### **Problem: TTS Not Firing**

- ❌ Old: TTS callback system was correct but timing was wrong
- ✅ New: TTS fires immediately, callback waits for recording

## 📋 New Flow (ALL Steps)

```
STEP STARTS
│
├─ 1. UI updates
├─ 2. Reset recording_ready flag
├─ 3. Initialize step data
│
├─ 4. START RECORDING (parallel)
│  └─ When complete: recording_ready = True
│
├─ 5. START TTS (parallel)
│  └─ When complete: TTS callback fires
│
├─ 6. TTS CALLBACK
│  ├─ Check: Is recording_ready = True?
│  ├─ If NO: Wait 100ms and check again
│  ├─ If YES: Wait 1 second
│  └─ Play beep
│
├─ 7. AFTER BEEP (500ms delay)
│  ├─ If calibration: Start calibration collection
│  └─ If gaze: Start gaze detection/simulation
│
└─ 8. STEP EXECUTES
   └─ Collect data until complete
```

## 🎯 Key Changes Made

### 1. **Added Recording Ready Flag**

```python
# In __init__
self.recording_ready = False

# In start_step_recording (after writers initialized)
self.recording_ready = True
```

### 2. **Removed Conflicting Code**

- ❌ Removed: `tts_complete`, `recording_complete`, `step_ready_callback`
- ❌ Removed: `check_step_ready()` method
- ❌ Removed: Orphaned dual-flag logic

### 3. **Unified execute_current_step Flow**

```python
def execute_current_step():
    # Reset flag
    self.recording_ready = False

    # Initialize data
    self.step_data = {...}

    # Start recording FIRST
    self.start_step_recording()

    # Start TTS with callback
    def after_tts_complete():
        # Wait for recording if needed
        def check_and_proceed():
            if self.recording_ready:
                # Wait 1 second
                self.root.after(1000, play_beep_and_execute)
            else:
                # Check again soon
                self.root.after(100, check_and_proceed)
        check_and_proceed()

    self.speak(instruction, after_tts_complete)
```

### 4. **Fixed Calibration Recording**

- ❌ Old: Calibration started recording 3 seconds after beep
- ✅ New: Calibration recording starts BEFORE TTS like all other steps

## ✅ Guarantees

1. ✅ **TTS fires for EVERY step** (calibration, gazes, sequences, holds)
2. ✅ **Recording starts for EVERY step** (including calibration)
3. ✅ **Beep ONLY fires when:**
   - Recording is initialized (`recording_ready = True`)
   - TTS is complete (callback fired)
   - 1 second has passed
4. ✅ **No race conditions** - polling checks ensure proper coordination
5. ✅ **Unified flow** - all steps follow the same pattern

## 🧪 Testing

### What Should Happen:

1. **Step starts** → UI updates immediately
2. **Recording starts** → Video writers initialize (~0.5s)
3. **TTS starts** → Instruction is spoken (~3s for average text)
4. **TTS completes** → Check if recording ready
5. **Both complete** → Wait 1 second
6. **Beep fires** → Audio signal
7. **Step executes** → Gaze detection or calibration begins

### Debug Output to Verify:

```
🔧 Recording setup complete - ready for beep
✅ TTS complete - checking if recording is ready
✅ Recording ready - waiting 1 second before beep
🔊 Playing beep...
🎬 Executing step: [Step Name]
```

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (Broken):

```
Step → TTS → Wait → Beep → START RECORDING → Execute
        ❌ Recording started AFTER beep
        ❌ Beep didn't wait for recording
        ❌ TTS might not fire
```

### After (Fixed):

```
Step → START RECORDING + START TTS (parallel)
    → Wait for BOTH complete
    → Wait 1 second
    → Beep
    → Execute
✅ Recording starts FIRST
✅ Beep waits for BOTH
✅ TTS always fires
```

## 🎉 Result

**The comprehensive gaze tester now has bulletproof timing with proper coordination between TTS, recording, and beep for all steps!**
